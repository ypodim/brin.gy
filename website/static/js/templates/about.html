<p>Brin.gy allows people to announce bits of information about themselves and find others based on that information. You can query the information that people announce and get the group of people interested in buying the same product, people with similar expertise, people in the same location, or any intersection of these examples.</p>
<p>When it comes to <b>"finding the right people"</b>, we need either a user account with some sort of social networking service, or a lot of patience to sift through online forums like Craigslist. When computers look for other computers though, they are consistently effective and their results are specific because they follow well-defined protocols, like DNS. Brin.gy similarly simplifies the process of announcing and quering information, making it easy to share information with people in <b>your class, your apartment building, the mall, your office</b>, or any other context you can think of.</p>

Brin.gy is actively developed at the 
<a href="http://viral.media.mit.edu">Viral Spaces</a> and 
<a href="http://eco.media.mit.edu">Information Ecology</a> groups at the 
<a href="http://media.mit.edu">MIT Media Lab</a>.

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>Q: Does this work on my mobile device?<br>
   A: While this interface works on iPad, it is not designed to be used on a mobile device. An iOS app is under development.</p>

<p>Q: How do I login using my pseudonym on a different device?<br>
   A: You can use your "admin URL" to edit your profile on any browser. The "admin URL" looks like <code>http://brin.gy/a/SECRETCODE</code> and appears when you create an account, in your "Account" box at the top-right of the page.</p>

<p>Q: Is there an API to access this data?<br>
   A: That's the whole idea behind this project. I'm writing documentation about it as we speak (sort of).</p>

<p>Q: Do you know about Quora/Aadvark?<br>
   A: Yes. Both are oriented towards answering questions, while Brin.gy attempts to serve as a discovery mechanism for people.</p>
